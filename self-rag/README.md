### Self-RAG (Self-Reflective Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a framework designed to improve the quality and factual accuracy of large language models (LLMs). Unlike traditional RAG methods that simply retrieve and use documents, Self-RAG enhances LLMs by adding a self-reflection mechanism. This approach allows the model to generate responses and then review and refine those responses based on the retrieved information. Self-RAG uses reflection tokens to guide the model in checking its own outputs for accuracy and relevance, which helps in producing more accurate and reliable answers for various tasks
